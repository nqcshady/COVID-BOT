# COVID-BOT
COVID-BOT is a Discord bot that lets users easily query and grab live COVID-19 statistics. [Uses the COVID-19 API authored by mathdroid.](https://github.com/mathdroid/covid-19-api)

Will update the rest of this readme later

# Donate
Any donations are appreciated [at my Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/cosmo) to keep my server running the bot afloat. Feel free to self-host the bot as well if you want.
